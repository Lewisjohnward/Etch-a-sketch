# Etch-a-sketch
day 0: I don't understand the DOM too well but I'm going to create a 4x4 div wall for the Etch-a-Sketch to start with and improve upon that. Scratch that, first we'll start with a single box I can't make a 4x4.

day 1: added input box that asks how many what size grid from 1x1 up to 64 x 64

day 2: makes new divs and trying to add a reset button that removes the divs
